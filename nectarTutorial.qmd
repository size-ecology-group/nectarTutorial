To get more resources, you are going to need to fill an application

## Application for resources

check with a student what it looks like

Once you have resources available in your project, you can start creating instances. If you have access to multiple projects, these can be selected in the top left corner in blue.


## Creating a nectar instance

In the sidebar at Project/Compute/Overview, you can check how much resources are available to create instances.

In there you can check how many instances you can create, as you can have more than one per project. How many VCPUs you can use (the number of cores) and much RAM they get access to (their memory) and many other details.
